# BadSorting
Dedicated to some random implementations of terrible sorting algorithms I'm implementing just for fun.
### Currently Implemented
**BogoSort** - Implemented in C, this nondeterministic algorithm "sorts" by checking if the array is sorted, then shuffling it (using the Fisher-Yates shuffle) if it isn't.

**ConwaySort** - A political joke, this algorithm completely ignores whatever array you give it and prints its own "sorted" array.
### Coming Soon
Bubble Sort, but in BF
